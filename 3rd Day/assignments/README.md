# Assignment

1. Given an unsorted interger array, write a function that returns the frequency of the highest value in the integer
   array.
    - **E.g Array**: `arr[] = {4, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 3}`
    - **Output**: `2 // Frequency of the Highest Value in the array`

2. Given a string S, write a function to reverse the words in the string but not the string itself.
    - **Input**: Hello this is a test
    - **Output**: `olleH siht si a tset`

3. Given an array, rotate the array by one position in Clock-wise direction.
    - **E.g Array**: `arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4 , 5}`
    - **Output**: `arr[] = {5, 1, 2, 3, 4}`

4. Given an integer array `arr[]` and a number `N`, write a function that prints all pairs in the array `arr[]`
   whose sum is equal to the number `N`.
    - **E.g Array**: `arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0}`
    - **Input**: `N = 5`
    - **Output**: `3 // [1+4=5, 2+3=5, 5+0=5]`

5. Given an integer 2D array `arr[][]`, we need to search for a value in the sorted matrix. `arr[][]` sorted matrix
   essentially means that the value at cell `arr[i][j]` will always be greater than the values of all cells preceding
   it.

6. Given a 2D array, it is filled with 0's and 1's. WAP that if it found 0 in the given matrix then its corresponding
   row and column will be changed to 0.
    - | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
            | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
      | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
      | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
    - **Note**: By converting the corresponding row and column to 0. Ultimately the whole matrix table will contain 0.

7. Write a program of 3D array. Is it 3D array or not. What is the position of element 10?
    - **Given Array**: `[[[4, 5, 6] [7, 8, 10] [12, 1, 15]]]`

8. Sort the array.
    - **Given Array:** `arr[] = {5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0}`
