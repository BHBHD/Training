# 1st Day - (December 8th, 2021)

## C / C++ Programing

1. [Functions](functions.c)

   - _be in sequence_
   - without carry, without return
   - without carry, with return
   - with carry, with return
   - with carry, without return
2. [Pointers](pointers.c)

   - *A variable which stores the address of another variable*
   - `*` Value at address
   - `&` Address of the node
   - Pointer-to-Pointer
3. [Recursion](recursion.c)

   - *Recursion is the function that call's itself.*
   - Best example would be factorial's code
4. Array

   - *Array is the collection of same type of data*
   - **Syntax:** `data_type variable_name[size_of_array]`
   - Sorting:
     - Bubble Sort
     - Selection Sort
   - Metrix || 3D Array
     - [Program](2d_array_diagonal_1.c) - Program to display diagonal of a 2D Array 1 and rest 0.
     - [Program](2d_array_sort.c) - Program to sort 2D Array without using temporary Array.
   - Array with Pointers
     - [Program](find_greatest_value_from_reference.c) - Program to find greatest element of an array from 1st element's address.
     - [Program](finding_cube_of_array_elements.c) - Program to display cubes of every element from address of 1st element.
5. Strings

   - *String is a collection of CHAR end by NULL character.*
   - String Operations:
     - Length
     - Copy
     - Concatenate
   - [Program](scroll_text_with_graphic.c) - Program to scroll text graphically using `graphic.h`
6. Structure

   - *Template of an object, by which we can copy similar data*
   - `.` These used to bind data.
   - **Syntax:**
     ```
           struct structure_name {
               data_type variable_name;
               ...
           }
     ```

# Assignment

1. Program to switch cases to UPPERCASE with ASCII.
    - [Program](assignments/string_to_upper_with_ascii_chart.c)
2. Program to reverse String without using String functions.
    - [Program](assignments/string_reverse_without_string_functions.c)
